# Sonic Focus Engine

Sonic Focus Engine is an experimental generative audio project designed to create long-form ambient soundscapes centered around specific frequencies rather than traditional keys. Its purpose is to produce deeply immersive audio environments that support focus, meditation, creative flow, and cognitive clarity.

## Project Overview

This project is not about conventional songwriting or sample-based composition. Sonic Focus Engine approaches sound as a living system. By starting with fundamental frequencies and shaping them through synthesis, modulation, and layering, it builds evolving, organic sound environments that change over time without relying on chord progressions or melodic structure.

The result is not a song but a space — a sound field that can last for hours, gently shifting and adapting as it plays.

## Core Principles

- **Frequency-Centered Composition**  
  All pieces begin with a user-defined fundamental frequency. Harmonics, overtones, and partials are generated algorithmically based on this foundation.

- **Generative Architecture**  
  Instead of pre-written compositions, Sonic Focus Engine uses probabilistic rules and evolving behaviors to shape sound over time. Each output is unique, even with the same input parameters.

- **Evolving Textures**  
  Layers drift, detune, phase, and modulate slowly, creating continuous motion without traditional "verses" or "choruses."

- **ADHD and Focus-Oriented Design**  
  The project is inspired by the idea that subtle, evolving audio environments can occupy parts of the brain that seek stimulation, freeing up cognitive bandwidth for deep work and concentration.

## Features (Planned)

- Generate WAV or MIDI audio based on a single fundamental frequency
- Add harmonic layers, partials, and overtone structures
- Apply modulation, drift, and gradual evolution over long time scales
- Export 1-hour, 2-hour, or infinite-duration soundscapes
- Optional seed-based randomness for repeatable or infinitely variable results
- Layer generation modes: drone, harmonic wash, partial texture, noise field

## Roadmap

**Phase 1:** Core audio generation engine  
- Generate basic sine wave drone  
- Add harmonic layers  
- Output WAV file for a defined duration

**Phase 2:** Advanced modulation and evolution  
- Add envelope shaping, slow LFO modulation, and dynamic changes  
- Support inharmonic partials and stochastic layer behavior  
- Implement seed-based repeatability

**Phase 3:** Full-featured application  
- Web interface for parameter input  
- Real-time preview and rendering  
- Preset library for different focus states and moods  
- Optional video export pipeline for YouTube-ready content

## Use Cases

- Deep work and study environments  
- Focus-enhancing background sound  
- Meditation and mindfulness audio  
- Sleep and relaxation soundscapes  
- Creative generative music composition

## Project Philosophy

Sonic Focus Engine is built around the idea that sound can be a tool, not just entertainment. It is not a SaaS product, not a streaming service, and not designed for commercial use. It is a creative instrument — a system designed to help its creator explore the intersection of sound, focus, and mental flow.

## Status

This project is in early development. The first prototype will focus on generating simple frequency-based WAV files and evolving them over time. More advanced features will follow once the core engine is stable.

## License

TBD. For now, this project is experimental and not licensed for commercial use.
